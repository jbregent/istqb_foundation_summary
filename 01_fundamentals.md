# 1. Fundamentals of Testing â€“ 180 minutes

## 1.1 What is Testing?

## 1.3. Testing Principles

1. Testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing saves time and money
4. Defects cluster together
5. Tests wear out
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence-of-defects fallacy

## 1.4. Test Activities, Testware and Test Roles

### 1.4.1. Test Activities and Tasks

* Test planning
* Test monitoring and control
* Test analysis
* Test design
* Test implementation
* Test execution
* Test completion

### 1.4.2 Test Process in Context
Testing is not performed in isolation.
The way the testing is carried out will depend on a number of contextual factors including:
* Stakeholders (needs, expectations, requirements, willingness to cooperate, etc.)
* Team members (skills, knowledge, level of experience, availability, training needs, etc.)
* Business domain (criticality of the test object, identified risks, market needs, specific legal regulations, etc.)
* Technical factors (type of software, product architecture, technology used, etc.)
* Project constraints (scope, time, budget, resources, etc.)

### 1.4.3. Testware
* Test planning work products
* Test monitoring and control work products
* Test analysis work products
* Test design work products
* Test implementation work products
* Test execution work products
* Test completion work products

## Quotes

Test results are used by QA and QC. In QC they are used to fix defects, while in QA they provide
feedback on how well the development and test processes are performing.
